# SGD Influence
Using a method called SGD Influence, the influence of the input images on recognition result is evaluated. The dataset and the scores are shown in the influential order, which can be referred for data cleansing.
The SGD Influence calculation in this plugin uses an approximate version of algorithm based on the following two papers.

# SGD Influence (Tabular)
Using a method called SGD Influence, the influence of the features in input table data on classification result is evaluated. The dataset index and the scores are shown in the influential order, which can be referred for data cleansing.
