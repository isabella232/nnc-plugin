# LIME (Image batch)
Using a method called LIME, the areas of the input image that affect the classification result are made visible in the model, which performs image classification. LIME(batch) processes all images in the specified dataset, while LIME processes a single image. This plugin can be used both for binary of multi class classifications.

# LIME (Tabular)
Using a method called LIME, a classification result is explained with the contribution of the features in input table data. Each feature is explained with a set of inequality and degree of contribution, which enables to interpret the classifier judgement. This plugin supports regression model and classification model with categorical features as well as model with continuous values.

# LIME (Tabular batch)

Each feature is explained with a set of inequality and degree of contribution, which enables to interpret the classifier judgement. This plugin supports regression model and classification model with categorical features as well as model with continuous values. LIME(tabular batch) processes all records in the specified dataset, while LIME(tabular) processes a single record.
